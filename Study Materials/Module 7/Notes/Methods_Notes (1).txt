Programming Paradigms:
1. Unstructured Style
2. Structured/Procedural/Functional Style
3. Object-Oriented Style


* In unstructured style of programming, large or complex programs are coded as a single-continuous block of code. It makes the program code hardly-readable. Hence, it is difficult to modify and debug.
* Supports limited basic data types.
* Programs are executed sequentially and uses unstructured control statements such as goto.
* Suitable only for small and simple projects.

Example: Earlier versions of BASIC, COBOL and FORTRAN. 


* In structured style of programming, large or complex programs are converted into smaller blocks of code so that managing the code becomes easy. Producing readable code.
* Hence, it is easier to modify and debug. Supports variety of data types.
* Programs are executed sequentially and uses structured control statements such as if/else/for/while, etc.
* Suitable for large and complex projects.

* These blocks of code are implemented as functions.
* Therefore, a function is a block of code or collection of statements grouped together to perform a certain task or operation.
However, the block of code only runs/executes when the function is called.

Example: C, C++, Visual Basic, etc.


1. A method, like a function, is a block of code or collection of statements grouped together to perform a certain task or operation. The difference is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not.
2. In Java, methods are used to implement the behavior of the object.
3. A method must always be declared within a class.
4. A method can directly access all the instance variables of the enclosing class.


Method declarations have six components, in order:
1. Modifiers— decides the visibility and accessibility of the method.
2. The return type—the data type of the value returned by the method, or void if the method does not return a value.
3. The method name— identifier, name of the behavior
4. The parameter list in parenthesis—a comma-separated list of input parameters, preceded by their data types. If there are no parameters, we must use empty parentheses.
5. An exception list— list of exceptions ducked.
6. The method body, enclosed between braces—the method's code, activity/behavior exhibited by the object.
